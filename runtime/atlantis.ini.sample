# Th√≠s file provides database connection details, so they
# are not hardcoded to the code and can be defined at runtime.
# First line defines the database name, second line defines
# the database user, third lines defines the password.
#
# Maximum length of any of the tree parameters is 29 characters!
#
# As this file is stored in plaintext, make sure only the file
# owner can read/modify this file.
#
# Original code used a simple encryption for the password
# storage, but to make the things easier, this was removed in the
# public release.
