# atlantistalker
Atlantis Talker is a talker based on NUTS. The talker runs as a service on a host machine and users can connect to the service using telnet protocol (e.g. `telnet example.com 7000` when the talker is bound to port 7000 on the host machine).

The code in this repository is a copy of the code published on SourceForge as SVN by one of the original coders nicknamed Spartakus.

The code of the Atlantis Talkers, that runs at `telnet talker.sk 7000`, is not public.
